# CodeWithHarry Notes: Variables & Data Types

Variables store data for later use. Python infers types at runtime.

## Common Types
- int, float
- str (strings)
- bool (True/False)
- list, tuple, dict, set

## Examples
```
name = "Harry"
age = 25
pi = 3.14
is_coder = True
skills = ["python", "js", "sql"]
print(name, age, pi, is_coder)
```

Experiment by changing values and printing types with `type(x)`.
