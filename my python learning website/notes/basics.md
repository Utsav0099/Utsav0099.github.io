# Python Basics Notes

Welcome! These notes summarize the essentials you need to start coding in Python.

## Printing

Use `print()` to display information.

```
print("Hello, World!")
```

## Variables

- Strings: `name = "Ada"`
- Integers: `age = 21`
- Floats: `pi = 3.14`
- Booleans: `is_active = True`

## Lists

```
nums = [1, 2, 3]
print(nums[0])
print(nums[1:3])
```

## Control Flow

```
for i in range(3):
    print(i)

if i % 2 == 0:
    print("even")
else:
    print("odd")
```

Keep practicing! Small daily exercises compound quickly.
